# A dynamic code for any length and order of part_columns list.
I'm having a list of part_columns, for eg. [vertical, partition_date,hour]
I need a bash code, such that
First find the position of partition_date in the list.
Check how many columns are to the left of it.
Then write a recursive for loop where all left most values get opened up for one particular partition_date.
Eg, if there are three values for first column vertical [home,mobility,other], then they should be written as {vertical}/partition_date.
output should be: 
home/partition_date,mobility/partition_date,other/partition_date 
one by one.

But if the case was for columns [utm,vertical, partition_date,hour]
and utm has values [skyc,jhd]
Then output should be: 
skyc/home/partition_date, skyc/mobility/partition_date, skyc/other/partition_date
and then 
jhd/home/partition_date, jhd/mobility/partition_date, jhd/other/partition_date
